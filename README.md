Optimal Portfolio Allocation and Stock Prediction

This project aims to optimize portfolio allocation using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Machine Learning. It involves analyzing historical stock data to balance risk and return, utilizing predictive insights from machine learning for better investment timing. 

Project Structure
Stock_prices_data.zip: Contains historical stock price data for the selected stocks. Essential for calculating returns, performing beta analysis, and training the prediction models.
Optimal Portfolio Allocation and Stock prediction.R: The primary R script implementing portfolio optimization and stock price prediction. This script includes functions for:
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and structures the stock price data.
Portfolio Optimization: Uses MPT to generate an optimized portfolio allocation based on historical returns and risk.
Machine Learning Prediction: Applies a Random Forest model to forecast stock prices for informed decision-making.
Visualization: Plots the predicted stock prices, optimized portfolio, Security Market Line, and other key insights.
Output.zip: Contains the outputs generated by the R script, including:
-Predicted stock prices for future dates.
-Visualizations for individual stock performance and portfolio growth.
-Optimized portfolio allocation data.
